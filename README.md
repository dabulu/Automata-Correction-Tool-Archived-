# Model-Correcting Tool

This code is an implementation of the standard competitive learning algorithm with some added changes to the algorithm.

## Requirements

The code was made in the Python 3.8 series. The libraries that the code makes use of are:

* Graphviz

If one of these is not installed, you can run the 'requirements.txt' file in the root directory with the command below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
While in the root directory:
For demo-ing purposes, see the TESTING AND DEMO SECTION in the file 'main.py' and adjust the 'test_automaton_selection' variable for demo-ing the 3 program features each in their own case.
For general use cases, see the ACTUAL USE SECTION in the file 'main.py'.

Run the file using the command below.

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter any inputs to the console thereafter as required (some of the program features require user input; see the VARIABLE DESCRIPTION SECTION in the file 'main.py' for further details)
